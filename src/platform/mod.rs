//! OS integration behind a small, platform-neutral facade.
//!
//! GPUI has no API for window position, always-on-top or hide/show, so those go through
//! [`NativeWindow`]. On Windows it talks to Win32 directly; elsewhere it is a no-op and
//! callers fall back to what GPUI offers.
//!
//! Win32 calls that resize or show a window send messages synchronously to GPUI's window
//! procedure, which then needs the app state. They must therefore never run while the app
//! is borrowed (inside an `update` or event handler); use [`NativeWindow::defer`].
